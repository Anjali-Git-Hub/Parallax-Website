          Physics is the natural science of matter, involving the study of
          matter,its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior
          through space and time, and the related entities of energy and
          force.Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific
          disciplines, with its main goal being to understand how the universe
          behaves.A scientist who specializes in the field of
          physics is called a physicist.

          Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its
          inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the oldest.Over much of the past
          two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of
          mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the
          Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences
          emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right.Physics
          intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as
          biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are
          not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the
          fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new
          avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as
          mathematics and philosophy.

          Advances in physics often enable new technologies. For example,
          advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state
          physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new
          products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such
          as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons;[3]
          advances in thermodynamics led to the development of
          industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development
          of calculus.
